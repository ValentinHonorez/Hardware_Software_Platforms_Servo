# Hardware_Software_Platforms_Servo

This project is part of the course Hardware/Software Platforms at the polytechnic faculty of Mons. 

The goal of this project is to control a servomotor with a DE1-SoC Board. It allows to learn the VHDL programming language and it allows to handle an entire electronical project.

 - Group Members: Fattahi Idriss and Honorez Valentin
 
 - Project title: Control of a servo-motor with a DE1-SoC.
 
The software used to implement the project is "Quartus II".

The main goal of the project is to be able to change the position of a servomotor by controlling the switches on the DE1-SoC board. There is a button available for the user on the board.

To achieve that, there are 4 parts in our code. 

The first one, called " clk64kHz.vhd", is the construction of the clock of 64kHz. 

The second one, called "servo_pwm.vhd" is the code building the PWM signal to control the servomotor. 

The third one, called "servo_pwm_clk64kHz.vhd" assemble the clock and the pwm signal to control the servomotor. 

The last one, called  "servo-pwm-clk64kHz_PINS.vhd" that connects the signals with the pins of the board.

The "DE1-SoC-Servo.zip" file countains the Altera project in it.
